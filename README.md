I started this project by importing data & creating an employee and their related work in the organization ,  demographics page that gives us the overall demographic outlook of the organization.
The steps that I’ve followed in this project were :-
1.	Importing data into Power BI from Kaggle (link mentioned above)
2.	Selecting dashboard background – there are many options for the theme of the dashboard , but I always use to like download a background from the internet of my own . (It’s there in my github repository).
3.	Creating dashboard- After setting the background for the project , I’ve started by including different data visualization tools for easy understanding. It includes cards, pie-chart , matrix , stacked bar graph , donut chart, KPI and slicer.
4.	Finishing dashboard  – After adding all the visualization tools to the dashboard with appropriate data , I’d adjusted all the visual effects including background colour , size of the text , headers, boundaries, and many more , according to the overall look of the dashboard.
